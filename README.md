# RL-Algorithms
This is a collection of Reinforcement Learning Algorithms for general implementation. The set of RL algorithms have been divided into two categories. The classic reinforcement Learning Algorithms and the more recent algorithms involving Deep Reinfocement Learning. 

**Classic (Simple) Reinforcement Learning Algorithms**
The theoretical basis of these algorithms is obtained from the book **"Reinforcement Learning - An Introduction (second edition)" by Richard S.Sutton and Andrew G. Barto**

**Deep Reinforcement Learning**
